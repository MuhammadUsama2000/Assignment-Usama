    The basis for the sports car is traced to the early 20th century touring cars and roadsters, and the term 'sports car' would not be coined until after World War One.[8][44]
 <br/><br/>
    A car considered to be "a sports-car years ahead of its time" is the 1903 Mercedes Simplex 60 hp,[45] described at the time as a fast touring car and designed by Wilhelm Maybach and Paul Daimler. The Mercedes included pioneering features such as a pressed-steel chassis, a gated 4-speed transmission, pushrod-actuated overhead inlet valves, a honeycomb radiator, low-tension magneto ignition, a long wheelbase, a low centre of mass and a very effective suspension system.[46] The overall result was a "safe and well-balanced machine" with a higher performance than any other contemporary production car.[47][48][49] At the 1903 Gordon Bennett Cup, a production Simplex 60 hp was entered only due to a specially-built 90 hp racing car being destroyed in a fire; the 60 hp famously went on to win the race.[50]
    <br/><br/>
    The 1910 Austro-Daimler 27/80 is another early sports car which had success in motor racing.[51] The 27/80 was designed by Ferdinand Porsche, who drove the car to victory in the 1910 Prince Henry Tour motor race.[52] The Vauxhall and Austro-Daimler— like the Mercedes Simplex 60 hp— were production fast touring cars.[53] The 1912 Hispano-Suiza Alfonso XIII is also considered one of the earliest sports cars, as it was a "purpose built, high performance, two-seater production automobile".[54] The model was named after King Alfonso XIII of Spain, a patron of the car's chief designer and an enthusiast for the marque.[54][55] Other early sports cars include the 1905 Isotta Fraschini Tipo D, the 1906 Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost, the 1908 Delage,[citation needed] the 1910 Bugatti Type 13[47][56][57] and the 1912 DFP 12/15.[47]
    <br/><br/>
    Early motor racing events included the 1903 Paris–Madrid race, the 1905-1907 Herkomer Trophy,[58] the 1908-1911 Prince Henry Tour and the 1911-present Monte Carlo Rally.[51] The Prince Henry Tours (which were similar to modern car rallies) were among the sporting events of the period, bringing renown to successful entrants. The Prince Henry Tours started the evolution of reasonably large and technically advanced production sports cars.[47][56]
    <br/><br/>
    In England, development of sporting cars was inhibited by the Motor Car Act 1903, which imposed a speed limit of 20 mph (32 km/h) on all public roads. This led to the 1907 opening of the Brooklands motor circuit, which inspired the development of performance cars such as the 1910 Vauxhall Prince Henry, 1910 Sunbeam 12/16,[59] 1910 Talbot 25 hp, 1910 Straker-Squire 15 hp and 1913 Star 15.9 hp.[56][60]
    <br/><br/>
    1919-1929: Vintage Era cars
    <br/><br/>
Bugatti Type 13 Brescia (1920)
<br/><br/>
1927 Austin 7 Brooklands (1927)
<br/><br/>
MG M-type Midget (1930)
Following the halt in sports car production caused by World War I, Europe returned to manufacturing automobiles from around 1920. It was around this time that the term 'Sports Car' began to appear in the motor catalogues, although the exact origin of the name is not known.[44] The decade which followed became known as the vintage era and featured rapid technical advances over the preceding Brass Era cars.[61][62] Engine performance benefited from the abandonment of "tax horsepower" (where vehicles were taxed based on bore and number of cylinders, rather than actual power output)[63] and the introduction of leaded fuel, which increased power by allowing for higher compression ratios.
<br/><br/>
In the early 1920s, the cost to produce a racing car was not significantly higher than a road car, therefore several manufacturers used the design from the current year's racing car for the next year's sports car.[44] For example, the 1921 Ballot 2LS based on the racing car that finished third at the 1921 French Grand Prix.[64] The Benz 28/95PS was also a successful racing car, with victories including the 1921 Coppa Florio.[51] Another approach— such as used by Morris Garages— was to convert touring cars into sports cars.[44][65]
<br/><br/>
The first 24 Hours of Le Mans race for sports cars was held in 1923,[44] although the two-seat sports cars only competed in the smallest class, with the majority of cars entered being four-seat fast touring cars.[66] "This race, together with the Tourist Trophy Series of Races, organised after the first World War by the R.A.C., appealed to the public imagination and offered to the manufacturers of the more sporting cars an excellent opportunity for boosting sales of their products."[44] The classic Italian road races— the Targa Florio, and the Mille Miglia (first held in 1927)— also captured the public's imagination.[44]
<br/><br/>
By 1925, the higher profits available for four-seater cars resulted in production of two-seat sports cars being limited to smaller manufacturers such as Aston-Martin (350 Astons built from 1921-1939) and Frazer-Nash (323 cars built from 1924–1939).[51] Then by the late 1920s, the cost of producing racing cars (especially Grand Prix cars) escalated, causing more manufacturers to produce cars for the growing sports car market instead.
<br/><br/>
Significant manufacturers[citation needed] of sports cars in the late 1920s were AC Cars, Alfa Romeo, Alvis, Amilcar, Bignan and Samson, Chenard-Walcker, Delage, Hispano-Suiza, Hotchkiss, Mercedes-Benz and Nazzaro.[51] Two cars from the Vintage Era that would influence sports cars for many years were the Austin Seven and MG M-type "Midget".[61][62] Successful sports cars from Bentley during this era were the Bentley 3 Litre (1921-1929) and the Bentley Speed Six (1928-1930), with the former famously described by Bugatti's founder as "the fastest lorry in the world".
<br/><br/>
1980-1999: Turbocharging and all-wheel drive emerge
<br/><br/>
Renault Fuego Turbo (1984)
<br/><br/>
McLaren F1 (1993-1998)
<br/><br/>
Porsche Boxster (986) (1996-2004)
Turbocharging became increasingly popular in the 1980s, from relatively affordable coupes such as the 1980-1986 Renault Fuego and 1992-1996 Rover 220 Coupé Turbo, to expensive supercars such as the 1984-1987 Ferrari 288 GTO and 1987-1992 Ferrari F40.
<br/><br/>
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, several manufacturers developed supercars which competed for production car top speed records. These cars included the 1986-1993 Porsche 959, 1991-1995 Bugatti EB 110, 1992-1994 Jaguar XJ220 and 1993-1998 McLaren F1.
<br/><br/>
The 1980-1995 Audi Quattro was a pioneering all-wheel drive sports car. The 1995 Porsche 911 Turbo (993) say the 911 Turbo model switch to all-wheel drive, a drivetrain layout that the model uses to this day.
<br/><br/>
The BMW M3 was released in 1986 and has been produced for every generation since. The 1993-1996 Mercedes-Benz W124 E36 AMG was the mass-produced AMG model.[81] Audi's equivalent division, called "RS", was launched in 1994 with the Audi RS 2 Avant.
<br/><br/>
Ford Europe withdrew from the sports car market at the end of 1986 when the Capri was discontinued after a production run of nearly two decades. There was no direct successor, as Ford was concentrating on higher performance versions of its hatchback and saloon models at the time.
<br/><br/>
In 1989, a new generation of Lotus Elan roadster was released which used a front-wheel drive layout, a controversial choice for a "purist" sports car. The Elan sold poorly and is was discontinued after three years. The 1996 Lotus Elise, a mid-engined, rear-wheel drive roadster, was much more successful and remains in production to this day.
<br/><br/>
Roadsters enjoyed a resurgence in the mid 1990s, including the 1989-present Mazda MX-5, the 1995-2002 BMW Z3 (succeeded by the 2002-2016 BMW Z4), the 1995-2002 MG F, the 1996-present Porsche Boxster and the 1998-present Audi TT.
<br/><br/>
2000-present: Turbos become dominant, hybrids emerge
<br/><br/>
Lotus Exige Series 2 (2004-2012)
<br/><br/>
Ferrari 488 (2015-2019)
<br/><br/>
BMW i8 (2014-2020)
The 2000-present Lotus Exige was introduced as a coupe version of Elise. Similarly, Porsche Cayman (987) was introduced in 2006 as the coupe equivalent to the Porsche Boxster roadster. Lotus also expanded their model range with the 2009-present Lotus Evora, a larger four-seat coupe.
<br/><br/>
Audi's first mid-engined supercar is the 2006-present Audi R8. Other sports cars of the 2000s were the 2005-2010 Alfa Romeo Brera/Spider, 2009-2015 Peugeot RCZ and the 2008-2017 reintroduction of the Volkswagen Scirocco (a coupe based on the VW Golf platform).
<br/><br/>
Reflecting overall car industry trends, the mid 2010s saw naturally aspirated engines being replaced by turbocharged engines. Ferrari's first regular production turbocharged engine was used in the 2014-2017 Ferrari California T, followed by the 2015-2019 Ferrari 488. Similarly, in 2016, the Porsche 911 (991.2) began to use turbocharging on all models and the Porsche 982 Cayman/Boxster downsized from a six-cylinder engine to a turbocharged four-cylinder engine.
<br/><br/>
Also in the 2010s, dual-clutch transmissions became more widespread, causing manual transmissions to decline in sales and no longer be offered on some models.
<br/><br/>
Hybrid-electric sports cars began to appear in the 2010s— notably the 2013-2016 LaFerrari, 2013-2015 McLaren P1, 2013-2015 Porsche 918 Spyder "hypercars". The 2014-present BMW i8 was also an early plug-in hybrid sports car.
<br/><br/>
McLaren began permanent car manufacturing operations with the 2011-2014 McLaren 12C.
<br/><br/>
In 2013, the Jaguar F-Type saw the brand return to two-seat sports car market, with the four-seat grand tourer Jaguar XK discontinued the following year.
<br/><br/>
The BMW 2 Series coupe and convertible were introduced in 2013 to sit below the larger BMW 4 Series models, with the new BMW M2 high-performance model introduced in 2015.
<br/><br/>
The 2013-present Alfa Romeo 4C two-seat coupe and roadster used a carbon-fibre body and became Alfa's mid-engine sports car since the 1967-1969 Alfa Romeo 33 Stradale.
<br/><br/>
Fiat had exited the roadster market with the end of Fiat Barchetta production in 2005. The company resumed production of roadsters in 2016 with the Fiat 124 Spider, which is based on the Mazda MX-5.
<br/><br/>
In 2017, Renault revived the Alpine brand for the 2017-present Alpine A110 mid-engine coupe.

During the 1910s and 1920s, American manufacturers of smaller sports cars included Apperson, Kissel, Marion, Midland, National, Overland, Stoddard-Dayton and Thomas; manufacturers of larger sports cars included Chadwick, Mercer,[82] Stutz Motor Company,[83][47] and Simplex.[84][51]
<br/><br/>
Since the 1960s, American performance cars have often been designed as muscle cars rather than sports cars. However, several American two-seat sports cars have also been produced, such as the 1953-present Chevrolet Corvette, 1962-1967 Shelby Cobra, 1983-1988 Pontiac Fiero and 2005-2006 Ford GT.
<br/><br/>
1989-2011: All-wheel drive, first supercars
<br/><br/>
Mazda MX-5 (1992-1993)
<br/><br/>
Honda NSX (2002-2005)
Inspired by the 1950s and 1960s two-seat roadsters from Italy and Britain, the Mazda MX-5 (sold as the 'Mazda Miata' in the United States) was introduced in 1989. The MX-5 is the highest selling sports car and remains in production to this day.
<br/><br/>
The Nissan Skyline GT-R was reintroduced in 1989-2002 (R32, R33 and R34 generations) which became famous for their use of turbocharging and all-wheel drive, which provided performance comparable with many more expensive sports cars. The latest generation (R35) was named the Nissan GT-R has been produced since 2007.
<br/><br/>
The 1990-2005 Honda NSX is considered Japan's first supercar. The NSX was praised for being more reliable and user-friendly than contemporary European supercars. Aside from the NSX, the other Japanese supercar is the 2010-2012 Lexus LFA, a two-seat mid-engine coupe powered by a 4.8 L (293 cu in) V10 engine.
<br/><br/>
The Mitsubishi GTO coupe/convertible was introduced in 1990. The base models used rear-wheel drive and a naturally aspirated V6 engine, however all-wheel drive and a turbocharged V6 engine were also available. To sit below the GTO in the model range, the Mitsubishi FTO front-wheel drive coupe was introduced in 1994. Both the GTO and FTO were discontinued in 2000.
<br/><br/>
Suzuki's first sports car was the 1991-1998 Suzuki Cappuccino, a two-seat roadster kei car with rear-wheel drive and a turbocharged 0.7 L (43 cu in) engine.
<br/><br/>
2012-present: Declining popularity of coupes
<br/><br/>
Toyota 86 (2012)
The Toyota 86 / Subaru BRZ is a 2+2 coupe that was introduced in 2012 and currently remains in production. The 86/BRZ is a rare modern example of a relatively affordable rear-wheel drive sports car.
<br/><br/>
The 2016-present Honda NSX (2nd generation) supercar marked a change in approach for Honda, by using all-wheel drive, a hybrid drivetrain, turbocharging and a dual-clutch transmission.
